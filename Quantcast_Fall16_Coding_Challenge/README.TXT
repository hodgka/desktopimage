I spent 14 hours working on the problem
Approximately 4 hours spent to implement Python solution.
Approximately 10 hours spent wrangling with C++.
Rest of time I had class/homework I needed to work on instead.

Included is:
    A solution written in Python.
    A solution written in C++.
    Test cases and some solutions used for debugging.


I was not prepared to use C++ (last year, python was allowed), so I wrote a solution is python first to convert over to C++. Since I have not used C++ in over a year, my C++ solution is very shaky. The python solution however is fully functional, documented, and has some alternate functionality. 


Test Cases:
1 - Given example input
2 - Ints, small grid
3 - Positive ints, negative ints, references, expressions
4 - Ints and references with cyclic dependencies
5 - Expressions with division by zero
6 - 100,000 Expressions, to check speed
7 - 1,000,000 Expressions, to check speed (see how it scales)
